break:

The break statement is used to stop the loop immediately when the condition is satisfied

Note: When python hits the break statement inside a "loop" - no matter if it is there directly inside the loop or its in conditions. Its breaks entire loop.



while loop ===> when condition criteria met you will stop looping/searching further more

	for vs while:

	- For loop typically used when you have a limited number of times you want to repeat a block of code

	- A while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code while a particular condition is true.
