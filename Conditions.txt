Conditions:

We use the conditional statement to run a block of code once condition is met.

if statement: 

Examples:

	if i get job in delhi ===> here, the condition is getting a job in delhi

		i have to search of place to live and transport

if-else statement:

Examples:

	if i get job in delhi ===> here, the condition is getting a job in delhi

		i have to search of place to live and transport
	else

		i wont accept the job offer at all.


2:

	if user_name is in database:

		already username taken

	elif user_name is empty

		Username cannot be blank

	else
		
		it is available


if - elif - else:

elif = else and if


Examples:

	if i get job in delhi ===> here, the condition is getting a job in delhi

		i have to search of place to live and transport

	elif if i get job in banglore:
	
		i dont need search for the place or transport

	elif if i get job in pune:

		i have to shift to the pune immediately
		
	else

		i wont accept the job offer at all.


Nested-if:


	if 12th standard student gets 70%

	   if that student gets rank of less > 1000 in IIT exam

		if the students gets the seat in Computer science

		    if the students graduates with more than 90%

			the student get a job at apple.

		    else
			the students don't get job at apple
                else
	
		    the student cant make it as computer science engineer
           else
		the student cant make to the top 1 tier college
        else
		the students needs to keep effort more
